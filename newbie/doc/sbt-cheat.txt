1) Found this for essentially doing an sbt clean within IntelliJ IDE:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29166100/intellij-fully-clean-re-resolve-and-rebuild-scala-sbt-project

(THEN @ Project directory on cmd-line, where build.sbt is):

This worked for me: "...close IntelliJ and delete all files in .idea/libraries"

cd /
find . -name ".idea"

goto specific project directory and

rm -rf .idea/libraries

AND:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4483230/an-easy-way-to-get-rid-of-everything-generated-by-sbt

sbt clean clean-files

sbt reload

sbt update

find . -name target -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;


2)  THEN; go into SBT-Project setup on IDEA15

- select SBT window on RHS
- hit REFRESH button to refresh
